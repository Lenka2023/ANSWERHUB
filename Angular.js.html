<div class="title strong"><span>What is AngularJS?</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS is a very popular MVW (Model/View/Whatever)
framework maintained by Google. AngularJS enables web
developers to impose MVC structures on their client-side
code and to build dynamic web applications more easily.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS introduces component-based architecture. It also
includes a variety of conventions that developers should
know and use, which will be presented in this Refcard.
AngularJS includes a wide range of features that help to build
Single Page Applications (SPAs) faster and is considered a
“one-stop shop” for creating SPAs. Another good aspect of
AngularJS is that it was written with testability in mind.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">You will learn that AngularJS is expressive, readable,
extensible, and quick to develop. All of these qualities
make AngularJS one of the best JavaScript frameworks for
application development</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">In this Refcard, you will get to know the essential parts of
AngularJS. The Refcard will also try to help you speed up your
development process when you use AngularJS. </span>

<div class="title strong"><span>A ngularJS Building Blocks</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">AngularJS includes a few building blocks that you should
know and understand:</span>
<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>Version</th><th>Implementations</th></tr><tr><td>Modules</td><td>Logical containers for different parts of AngularJS objects</td></tr><tr><td>Controllers</td><td>A constructor functions that are used to hold scopes and expose behaviors that views can use</td></tr><tr><td>Scopes</td><td>Objects that reference the application model</td></tr><tr><td>Views</td><td>HTML that presents the models and interacts with the user</td></tr><tr><td>Templates</td><td>HTML that contains AngularJS-specific elements and attributes</td></tr><tr><td>Services</td><td>Objects that enable you to organize and share code in an AngularJS application</td></tr><tr><td>Filters</td><td>Transform the model data to an appropriate representation in the view</td></tr><tr><td>Directives</td><td>Reusable web components that tell the AngularJS HTML compiler how to render them and how the components behave. Can help you enrich the existing HTML elements or create your own custom ones</td></tr><tr><td>Routing</td><td>A module that maps URLs to application states / handles state and view switching</td></tr><tr><td>Dependency
Injection</td><td>Design pattern that deals with how to
inject dependencies to a dependent object.
AngularJS uses this pattern and enables you
to inject dependencies in a declarative way.</td></tr></tbody></table>
