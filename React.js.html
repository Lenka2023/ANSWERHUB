<div class="title strong"><span>WHAT IS REACT.JS?</span></div>
<br><span class="move_left">React (a.k.a. ReactJS or React.js) is a JavaScript library 
for creating user interfaces, open sourced to the 
world by Facebook and Instagram team in 2013. One 
might think of it as the “View” in the “Model-View-
Controller” pattern.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">React’s main goal is to make development of UI 
components easy and modular. It is intended to ease 
the process of building large applications using data 
that changes over time.
</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer 
at Facebook, with the influence of XHP, a PHP-based 
component system that is still in use at Facebook, but 
also by functional programming ideas. Pete Hunt wanted 
to use React at Instagram, so he pushed to extract React 
from Facebook-specific code and open source it.</span>

<br><span class="move_left">React has gained a lot of popularity for its concept of 
a “virtual-DOM,” which allows it to determine which 
parts of the DOM have changed by diffing the new 
version with the stored virtual DOM, and using the 
result to determine how to most efficiently update the 
browser’s DOM.</span>

<div class="title strong"><span>HOW THE MAGIC HAPPENS</span></div>

<br><span class="move_left">To get an idea of what’s going on inside React, take 
a look at the following diagrams demonstrating how 
React.js rendering and the React Virtual DOM work:</span>
<br><span class="move_left "><span class="strong ">FIGURE 1:</span>REACT.JS RENDERING</span>
<br><span class="move_left "><span class="strong ">FIGURE 2:</span>THE REACT VIRTUAL DOM</span>

<br><span class="move_left">React basically batches DOM updates and then applies 
minimal diffs to the real DOM.</span>

<br><span class="move_left">React components implement a 
render()
method that 
takes input data and returns what to display.</span>

<br class="cbt">

<br><span class="move_left">Here is an example of a simple “Hello” Component:</span>
<div class="commands"><pre>var Hello = React.createClass({
render: function () {
return <div>Hello {this.props.name}</div>;
}
});
React.render(<Hello name="World" />, document.body);</pre></div>
<br><span class="move_left "><span class="strong ">NOTE:</span>The XML-like syntax shown is called JSX.</span>

<br><span class="move_left">Here is the same component without JSX:</span>

<div class="commands"><pre>var Hello = React.createClass({displayName: "Hello",
render: function() {
return React.createElement("div", null, "Hello ", this.
props.name);
}
});
React.render(React.createElement(Hello, {name:
"World"}), mountNode);</pre></div>

<div class="title strong"><span>COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS</span></div>
<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>NAME</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr><tr><td>render</td><td>The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify the component state. It should examine this. props and this.state and return a single child element.</td></tr><tr><td>getInitialState</td><td>Invoked once before the component is mounted. The return value will be used as the initial value of this.state.</td></tr><tr><td>getDefaultProps</td><td>Invoked once and cached when the class is created. Values in the mapping will be set on this.props.</td></tr><tr><td>propTypes</td><td>The propTypes object allows you to validate props being passed to your components.</td></tr><tr><td>mixins</td><td>The mixins array allows you to use mixins to share behavior among multiple components.</td></tr><tr><td>statics</td><td>The statics object allows you to define static methods that can be called on the component class.</td></tr><tr><td>displayName</td><td>The displayName string is used in debugging messages. JSX sets this value automatically.</td></tr></tbody></table>

<table class="syntax_description"><tbody><tr><th>NAME</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr><tr><td>setState</td><td>Merges nextState with the current state.</td></tr><tr><td>replaceState</td><td>Like setState(), but deletes any pre-existing state keys that are not in nextState.</td></tr><tr><td>forceUpdate</td><td>Call render() on the component, skipping shouldComponentUpdate().</td></tr><tr><td>React.findDOMNode (0.13+)</td><td>Returns the corresponding native browser DOM element</td></tr><tr><td>isMounted</td><td>Returns true if the component is rendered into the DOM.</td></tr><tr><td>setProps</td><td>Changes the properties and triggers a rerender.</td></tr><tr><td>replaceProps</td><td>Like setProps(), but deletes any preexisting props instead of merging the two objects.</td></tr></tbody></table>
